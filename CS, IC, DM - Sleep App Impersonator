-- Think about your favorite apps, and pick one that stores your data- like a game that stores scores, an app that lets you post updates, etc. Now in this project, you're going to imagine that the app stores your data in a SQL database (which is pretty likely!), and write SQL statements that might look like their own SQL.

CREATE a table to store the data.
INSERT a few example rows in the table.
Use an UPDATE to emulate what happens when you edit data in the app.
Use a DELETE to emulate what happens when you delete data in the app.

CREATE TABLE Persona (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    First_name TEXT,
    Last_name text,
    age INTEGER,
    address text);
    
    CREATE TABLE Hours (
    Person_id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    Hrs_sleep integer,
    Hrs_work INTEGER,
    Hrs_internet_browse integer,
    Mood text );

INSERT INTO Persona (First_name, Last_name, age, address) VALUES ("Rob", "Pascoe", 51, "31969 Pembroke, Livonia, MI 48152");

   
INSERT INTO Persona (First_name, Last_name, age, address) VALUES ("Heather", "Pascoe", 41, "31969 Pembroke, Livonia, MI 48152");

INSERT INTO Persona (First_name, Last_name, age, address) VALUES ("Maureen", "McGuire", 54, "28780 Appleblossom, Farmington Hills, MI 48331");

INSERT INTO Persona (First_name, Last_name, age, address) VALUES ("Sue", "Pascoe", 80, "28780 Appleblossom, Farmington Hills, MI 48331");
 
--data for Hours table

INSERT INTO Hours (Hrs_sleep, Hrs_work, Hrs_internet_browse, Mood) VALUES (5, 2.5,8, "Tired");
INSERT INTO Hours (Hrs_sleep, Hrs_work, Hrs_internet_browse, Mood) VALUES (6, 9,2, "Energized");
INSERT INTO Hours (Hrs_sleep, Hrs_work, Hrs_internet_browse, Mood) VALUES (8, 8,5, "Sleepy");
INSERT INTO Hours (Hrs_sleep, Hrs_work, Hrs_internet_browse, Mood) VALUES (3, 12,1, "Exhausted");

Select * from Hours;
Select * from Persona;
select * from Persona where age > 40;

Select * from Persona;
UPDATE Hours set Mood = "Need more sleep" WHERE Person_id = 1;
Select * from Hours;
select * from Persona where address LIKE "%Pembroke%";

SELECT * FROM Persona WHERE First_name IN ("Rob", "Sue");
DELETE FROM Persona WHERE address like "%Pembroke%";
select * from Persona;
DELETE FROM Persona WHERE age > 40;
select * from Persona;
